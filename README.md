# delta-spike-dynamic-content_issue

This branch of code is meant to be testing the  https://github.com/rdebusscher/AdvancedGraphicImageRenderer .

The bugfixes encountered are going to be checked in the fork: https://github.com/99sono/AdvancedGraphicImageRenderer 


Ultimately, the hope is to use:
https://github.com/rdebusscher/AdvancedGraphicImageRenderer

As temporary project dependency until a stable checking is provided in either the maint delta spike project or prime faces so that View Access Scoped beans and Dnynamic Graphic Images work.
Otherwise, this will be a code maintenance nightmare, as time goes by.
